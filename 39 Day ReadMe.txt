Day 39 -> read(), readlines() and other methods 


read() Method:
read() reads the entire content of the file as a single string.
You can also pass a number to read only that many characters.

readline() Method:
readline() reads one line at a time from the file.
Each call moves to the next line.

write() Method:
write() writes a string to the file.
You must open the file in write (w) or append (a) mode.

writelines() Method:
writelines() writes a list of strings to the file without adding newlines automatically, so you must include \n yourself.
