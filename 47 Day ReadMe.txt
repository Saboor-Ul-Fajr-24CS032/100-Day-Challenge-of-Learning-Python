Day 47 -> Getters and Setters in python


Getters:
Getters are special methods used to access the value of a private property in a class.
They hide the internal data and let you read it safely.
In Python, you usually define a getter using the @property decorator.

Setters:
Setters are methods used to set or update the value of a property.
They are defined using @property_name.setter.
They let you validate or control how the data changes.
