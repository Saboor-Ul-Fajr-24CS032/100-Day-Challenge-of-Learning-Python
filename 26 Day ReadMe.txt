Day 26 -> Dictionaries

Python Dictionaries:

Before python 3.7 dictionaries are unordered, but now Dictionaries are ordered collection of data items.
It's used to store data where each value is accessed using a unique key. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}.

Accessing a Single Value:

You can access a value by using its key in square brackets [] or with .get() method.
simple accesssing from square barckets will give  you an error if there is not a item in it , but using .get() with variable will give you no error , if the item is not available

Accessing Multiple Values:

You can loop through the dictionary to get multiple values or you cam also use .value() function.

Accessing Keys:

Keys are the unique identifiers used to access values.To access a key , we can use .keys()

Accessing Key-Values pairs:

You can get all key-value pairs using .items() or you can use loops for them.
