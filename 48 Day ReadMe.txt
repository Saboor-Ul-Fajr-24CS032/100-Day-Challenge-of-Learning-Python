Day 48 -> Inheritance


Inheritance:
Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a child class automatically acquires the properties and methods of a parent class.
It allowing code reuse and creating an “is-a” relationship between classes.

1. Single Inheritance
A child class inherits from one parent class. This promotes simple code reuse.
Example: Child inherits from Parent.

2. Multiple Inheritance
A child class inherits from multiple parent classes. This merges features from multiple sources.
Example: Son inherits from Mother and Father.

3. Multilevel Inheritance
A chain where a class is derived from a child class which itself is derived from another class — like Grandfather → Father → Son.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance
One parent class, multiple child classes. Each child inherits the same base features.
