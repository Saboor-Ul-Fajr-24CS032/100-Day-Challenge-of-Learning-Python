Day 28 -> For loop with else

Using else with for Loop:
Python allows an else block with for. The else part runs only if the loop completes normally, without a break.

Using else with while Loop:
Just like for, an else block with while runs only when the loop ends normally, not by break.

Else with for loop and break in Python:
In Python, when you use an else block with a for loop, the else block only runs if the for loop completes without hitting a break statement.
In the case where you hit a break statement , the else statement will not be executed.
This is useful when you're searching for something and want to know if the loop ended naturally or was stopped early.

Else with while loop and break in Python:
Just like the for loop, a while loop in Python can also have an else block.
The else part runs only when the loop finishes normally, meaning the condition becomes false without a break.
If the loop is exited using break, then the else block is skipped.
