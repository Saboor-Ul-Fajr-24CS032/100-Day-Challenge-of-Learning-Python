Day 54 -> dir , __dict__ amd help method in python



dir(), __dict__, and help() Methods in Python:
In Python, these three built-in tools help us explore and understand objects, especially in object-oriented programming.

dir() Method:
The dir() function returns a list of all attributes and methods of an object, including special (dunder) methods.

__dict__ Attribute:
The __dict__ attribute shows the internal dictionary of an objectâ€™s attributes. It is especially useful in classes to see the values assigned via the constructor.

help() Method:
The help() function displays the official documentation for objects, classes, or modules. It shows available methods, parameters, and usage.
