Day 12 -> For loops 

Loops:
Loops in Python allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times.
They are used to perform repetitive tasks like printing items, processing data, or iterating over collections like strings and lists.
The two main types are: for loop and while loop.

For Loop in Python:
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a string, list, tuple, etc.).
It runs the block of code once for each item in the sequence.
