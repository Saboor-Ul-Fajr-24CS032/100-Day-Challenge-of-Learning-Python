Day 13 -> While Loop

while loop:
A while loop is a control flow structure in Python that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.
It’s used when you don’t know in advance how many times you need to run the loop—unlike a for loop which runs a fixed number of times.


while with else:
In Python, a while loop can have an else block that runs after the loop finishes normally (i.e., not interrupted by break).
