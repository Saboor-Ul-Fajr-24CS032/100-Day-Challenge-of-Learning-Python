Day 55 -> Super Keyword


super() Keyword in Python:
The super() function is used to access methods from a parent class in a child class. It helps us reuse code from the parent class without rewriting it.

Why Use super():
When a class inherits from another class, it can override its methods. But sometimes, we still want to call the original method from the parent — and that’s when super() is useful.
