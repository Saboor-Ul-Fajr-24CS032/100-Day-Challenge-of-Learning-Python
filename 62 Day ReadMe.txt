Day 62 -> Hybrid and Hierarchical Inheritance


Hybrid Inheritance in Python:
Hybrid inheritance is a mix of multiple and multilevel inheritance.
It allows a class to combine features from different sources and create a more flexible hierarchy.
It combines strengths of multiple inheritance types.
It is useful for real-world class models.
It offers more structure, reusability, and flexibility.

Hierarchical Inheritance in Python:
Hierarchical inheritance is when one base class is inherited by multiple subclasses.
It allows common features to be shared, while each subclass can still have its own unique behavior.
It reduces repetition of code.
It keeps structure clean and organized.
It is useful when multiple classes share the same base behavior.
