Day 14 -> Break and Continue


break Keyword in Python:
The break statement is used to exit a loop immediately, even if the loop condition is still true.
Once break is encountered, Python jumps out of the loop and continues with the code after it.


continue Keyword in Python:
The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and jump to the next iteration.
It does not stop the loop, but simply ignores the remaining code for that iteration.
