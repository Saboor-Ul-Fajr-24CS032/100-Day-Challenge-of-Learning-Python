Day 25 -> Sets Methods in python 

Joining Sets:
We can perform operations like union and intersection on the sets just like in mathematics.

1. union() and update():
The union() and update() methods prints all items that are present in the two sets.

2.intersection and intersection_update():
The intersection() and intersection_update() methods prints only items that are similar to both the sets.

3. symmetric_difference and symmetric_difference_update():
The symmetric_difference() and symmetric_difference_update() methods prints only items that are not similar to both the sets.

4. difference() and difference_update():
The difference() and difference_update() methods prints only items that are only present in the original set and not in both the sets.
