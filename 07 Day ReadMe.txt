Day -> Strings

What is a String:
A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").
Strings are used to store text such as names, sentences and also use in print statements etc.


1. Single line  Strings:
You create a string by enclosing text in quotes—either single (' ') or double (" ").

2. Multi line String:
You can create a multiline string by using triple quotes—either single (' ') or double (" ").

3. Accessing using Indexing:
Each character has a position (index) starting from 0 in a string.

4. Accessing using loop:
Strings are sequences of characters, so you can use loops to go through each character individually. This is helpful when you want to count letters, check characters, or modify text.
