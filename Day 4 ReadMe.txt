Day -> Variables and data types

Variable:

A variable in Python is a named space in memory used to store data values. Variables can hold different types of data, like numbers, text, or more complex structures.

Data types:

Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold, such as numbers, text, or logical values.  Python includes types like integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), booleans (bool), and complex numbers (complex) for real and imaginary parts.Choosing the right data type helps programs store and process information correctly and efficiently.

List:

A list is an ordered collection of items that can be changed after creation. Lists allow storing multiple values in one variable, and items can be added, removed, or modified. They are defined using square brackets [].

Tuple:

A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. Tuples are used to store fixed collections of items and are defined using parentheses (). They are useful when data integrity is important.

Dictionary:

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. It allows fast access to data by using keys instead of numeric indexes. Dictionaries are defined with curly braces {} and are great for storing related information.
