Day 10 -> If-else

if and else Statements:
Python uses if statements to make decisions. It checks a condition â€” if it's True, it executes the indented block of code.
If the condition is False, and there's an else statement, then that block will be executed instead.

elif (It is short for else-if):
When you have more than two possible conditions, you use elif.
It allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.

Nested if-else Statements:
You can write an if statement inside another if or else block.
This is called nesting and is useful for checking sub-conditions based on a larger condition.
