Day 41 -> lambda Function 



Lambda Function:
In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function — meaning it has no name. It is defined using the lambda keyword and follows this structure
A lambda function can have one or more arguments, but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned automatically.
Lambda functions are handy when you need a quick, simple function for a short time and don’t want to formally define it with def. 
They are mostly used inside higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(), where you pass a small function as an argument.

Example:
Single arguments
lambda x: x * 2

Multiple arguments:
lambda x, y: x * y
