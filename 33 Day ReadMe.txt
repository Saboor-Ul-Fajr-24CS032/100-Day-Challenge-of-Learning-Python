Day 40 -> Enumertae Function


enumerate() in Python:
The enumerate() function is used when you are looping through a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and you also want to keep track of the index (position) of each item.

Normally, when you use a for loop, you only get the value. But enumerate() allows you to get both the index and the value at the same time.

Syntax of enumerate(): 
enumerate(iterable, start=0)
