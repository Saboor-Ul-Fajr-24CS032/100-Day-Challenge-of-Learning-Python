Day 24 -> Sets in python 

Sets :
Sets are unordered collection of data items. They store mutiple items in single variable and items are seperated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets . 

Sets do not contain duplicate iems , and they can't change after once the set is created. 

Members can't be excessed by index number , because they can't keep up with order.
