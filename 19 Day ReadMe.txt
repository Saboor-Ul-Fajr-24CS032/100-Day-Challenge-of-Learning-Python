Day 19 -> Introduction to Tuples


What is a Tuple?
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items.
It means: once created, you cannot change (add/remove/update) its items.
Tuples use round brackets (), unlike lists which use [].

Positive Indexing in Tuples
Indexing starts from 0, just like lists.
You access items using their position.

Negative Indexing in Tuples
You can access items from the end using negative numbers.
-1 refers to the last item
