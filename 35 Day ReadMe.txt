Day 42 -> if  __name__== "__main__"



if __name__ == "__main__" in Python:
It is a special conditional statement in Python used to check whether a Python script is being run directly or is being imported into another script.

In Python, __name__ is a built-in variable automatically set by the interpreter. If the script is run directly, __name__ is set to "__main__"; if imported, it is set to the moduleâ€™s name.


Why is it useful:
It helps separate the code that should run directly from the code that should only be imported and reused.

This allows your script to be used both as a standalone program and as a reusable module without running unintended code.


Is it necessary?
It is not required to run Python code, but it is a best practice for clean, modular, and reusable code.
