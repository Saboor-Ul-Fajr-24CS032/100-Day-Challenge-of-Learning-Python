Day 65 -> Walrus Operator 


Walrus Operator:
The Walrus Operator (:=) lets you assign a value and use it in the same expressionâ€”reducing repetition and making code more compact.
Use the Walrus Operator only when it improves clarity. Overusing it may confuse readers.
The Walrus Operator saves lines especially in loops and conditions, but use it wisely for clean, readable code.
