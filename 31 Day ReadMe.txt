Day 38 -> Customs Errors


Custom Errors in Python:
Python already has built-in errors like ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, etc., but sometimes in your own programs, you may want to create your own specific errors.
These are called custom exceptions and are useful when you want to show more meaningful error messages for special situations in your code.

Raise in Python:
The raise keyword is used to manually throw (raise) an error in your program. You can raise either a built-in error like ValueError, or a custom error you defined yourself.
It is used when you want to stop the program or handle a specific case by throwing an exception.\
