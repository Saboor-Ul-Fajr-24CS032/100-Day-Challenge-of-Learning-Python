Day 46 -> Decorators in python


Python Decorators are special functions used to modify or extend the behavior of other functions or methods without changing their source code.
They take a function as input, wrap extra functionality around it, and return the new, enhanced function.

Syntax:
Use @decorator_name above a function

Decorators help you:
Add features like logging, timing, or security checks.
Avoid repeating code — write it once, reuse it for many functions.
Keep code clean — you don’t mix extra logic inside your main function.
