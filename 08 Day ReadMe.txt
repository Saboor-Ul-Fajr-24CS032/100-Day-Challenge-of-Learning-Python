Day 8 -> String slicing and operation of string

Strings as Arrays (Indexing):
In Python, strings work like arrays of characters. Each character has a position (index), starting from 0. You can also use negative indexing to access from the end.

Length of a String:
To find the total number of characters in a string, use the len() function

String Slicing in Python:
Slicing means getting a part of the string using a range of indexes. The basic format is:  string[start:end].
Python takes characters from start index up to (but not including) end.

Negative Index Slicing:
You can use negative indexes to slice from the end. and minus the given index from length of the string and can get the answer.

Full Slicing Syntax:
The full slicing syntax is:  string[start:end:step].

start: where to begin

end: where to stop (not included)

step: how many steps to jump
