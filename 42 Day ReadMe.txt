Day 42 -> Map , Filter and Reduce in python


map() — Transform Each Element:
Purpose: Applies a given function to each item in an iterable.
Result: Returns a new iterable with the transformed items.
Syntax: map(function, iterable)

filter() — Select Certain Elements:
Purpose: Filters items based on a condition (predicate).
Result: Returns a new iterable with only items that pass the condition.
Syntax: filter(predicate, iterable)

reduce() — Combine to a Single Value:
Purpose: Repeatedly applies a function to pair of elements to reduce the iterable to one final value.
Result: Returns a single result (like sum, product, etc.).
Syntax: reduce(function, iterable)
