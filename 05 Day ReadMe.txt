Day 5 -> Typecasting in python

Typecasting in Python:
Typecasting is the process of converting one data type into another, such as converting a string into an integer or a float into a string.
It helps to make different data types compatible for operations.

Types of Typecasting:
There are two types of typecasting in Python.

. Implicit Typecasting

. Typecasting


1. Implicit Typecasting:
Implicit typecasting is done automatically by Python when needed.
It converts smaller data types to larger ones (e.g., int to float) without loss of data.

2. Explicit Typecasting:
Explicit typecasting is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.
