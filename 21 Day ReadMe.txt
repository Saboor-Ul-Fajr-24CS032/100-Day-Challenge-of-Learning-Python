Day 21 fstring


f-string:
An f-string, short for formatted string literal, is a special type of string in Python that allows you to directly embed Python expressions, variables, or even calculations inside the string by using curly braces {}. It makes creating dynamic and readable strings very easy and concise.

How it works:

To create an f-string, you put an f or F before the opening quotation mark of your string.

Inside this string, whenever you write an expression inside {}, Python will evaluate it and insert the result at that place in the string.

This means you donâ€™t have to use cumbersome + operators or the format() method to build complex strings.
