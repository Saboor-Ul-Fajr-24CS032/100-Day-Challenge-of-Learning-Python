Day 44 -> Introduction to OOPs



Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Programming has two main styles.
1. Procedural Programming — follow steps one by one (what you did before).
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — organize code using classes and objects that mimic real-world things.

Classes and Objects:
Class: A blueprint or template that defines properties (data) and methods (actions).
Object: An instance of a class — it has its own values but shares the same methods.

Key OOP Features in Python
Encapsulation: Hides an object’s internal data; access is only through methods.
Inheritance: New classes can inherit properties and methods from existing classes — helps reuse code.
Polymorphism: Lets different classes be treated as the same type — increases flexibility.

self Parameter
Inside a method, self refers to the current object.
It lets you access the class’s data and methods.
