Day 70 -> Regular Expressions in python


Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python:
Regular Expressions (regex) are a powerful way to search, match, and manipulate text in Python.
With just a few lines of code, you can find words, validate inputs (like emails), or replace text based on patterns.

Common Metacharacters in Regex:

[] – Matches any character in a set
^ – Matches the start of a string
$ – Matches the end of a string
. – Matches any character (except newline)
? – Matches zero or one occurrence
| – Acts as OR
* – Matches zero or more occurrences
+ – Matches one or more occurrences
{} – Defines specific number of repetitions
() – Groups multiple regex parts together

Why Use Regex:

It can quickly search or validate text
It can extract data (emails, phone numbers, etc.)
