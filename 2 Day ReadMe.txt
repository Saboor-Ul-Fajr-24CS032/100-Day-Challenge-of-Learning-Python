Day 2 -> Modules and Pip


Modules in Python

Modules are Python files that contain reusable code like functions, classes, or variables.

They help keep code organized and prevent repetition.

Example: import math lets you use math-related functions like math.sqrt().


Types of Modules in Python

There are two main types of modules in Python:

Built-in Modules – Already included with Python, like math and random.

User-defined Modules – Made by you to reuse your own code, like mycode.py.


Pip in Python

Pip is Python’s package manager used to install external modules from the internet.

It allows easy access to thousands of libraries like NumPy, pandas, and requests.

Example: Run pip install pandas in the terminal to install the pandas library.
