Day 57 -> Method Overriding


Method Overriding:
Method overriding means redefining a method in a child class that already exists in the parent class.
When an overridden method is called on an object of the child class, the child class's version is executed, not the parentâ€™s.
The overridden method must have the same name and parameters.
It allows custom behavior while keeping the same interface (function name and signature).
