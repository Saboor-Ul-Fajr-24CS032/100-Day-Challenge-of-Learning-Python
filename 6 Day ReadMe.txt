Day 6 -> Taking input from user


Taking User Input in Python:
In Python, user input is taken using the input() function. It allows the user to enter data during program execution.

1. Basic Input:
When you use input(), it always takes the input as a string by default.

2. Input with Type Conversion:
If you want to take a number as input (like an integer or a float), you need to convert the input manually using typecasting.
