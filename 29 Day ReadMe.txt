Day 29 -> Exception Handling

Exception Handling:
Exception handling is the process of responding to errors (called exceptions) that occur during the execution of a program.
Instead of crashing, a program can catch these errors and handle them gracefully so the rest of the code keeps running.

Exception Handling in Python:
In Python, exception handling is done using the keywords:
try, except, else, and finally.
Python lets you wrap error-prone code inside a try block and handle any errors in the except block.

1. try block: This block contains the code that might raise an error.

2. except block: If an error occurs in the try block, Python jumps to the except block.
