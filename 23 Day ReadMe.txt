Day 23 -> Recursion 



Recursion:
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. The idea is to break down a complex problem into smaller, similar subproblems until you reach a simple, solvable case known as the base case.
In Python, recursion is commonly used to solve problems that naturally follow a repetitive pattern, like tree traversal, factorial calculation, or the Fibonacci sequence.
