Day 11 -> Match Case


match-case in Python:
The match-case statement is used to handle multiple possible values or patterns of a variable. Itâ€™s similar to the switch statement in other languages like C, Java, or JavaScript. Instead of writing many if-elif-else conditions, match-case provides a cleaner and more readable structure.

WorkIng:
. The match keyword is followed by a variable you want to check.
. Inside it, different case blocks represent the values or patterns to compare with that variable.
. Only the first matching case will be executed.
. The _ (underscore) is a special case that works like else or default, and runs if none of the other cases match.
In python there is no break keyword.
