Day 15 -> Functions 


Function in Python:
A function in Python is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. 
Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can define a function once and use it wherever needed. 
Functions help in organizing code, improving readability, and making it easier to debug or reuse.


Defining a Function
You use the def keyword to define a function:
def function_name():


Calling a Function:
You can call a function like that:
function_name()


Built-in Functions:
These are functions that come pre-defined in Python. You can use them directly without writing their code.


User-defined Functions:
These are functions that you create yourself using the def keyword.
They allow you to write custom logic and reuse it whenever needed.
